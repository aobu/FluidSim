# FluidSim
A real-time fluid simulation implemented in C++ using Jos Stam's "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" algorithm. This project utilizes the GLFW library for window management and OpenGL rendering. The simulation models fluid behavior in real-time, allowing users to interact with the fluid through mouse inputs.
